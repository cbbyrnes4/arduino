Arduino files

Just a few (mini)projects I worked on while I was in middle school. Most of these are barely even half-baked. 
Arduino was a huge turning point for me when I was younger and really jump-started my interest in computer science/coding. As such,
I figured I should showcase some of the stuff I worked on.
